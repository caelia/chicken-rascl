RASCL's a Simple Configuration Language
=======================================

RASCL is a simple declarative language for runtime application
configuration. Its distinguishing characteristics include:

 * Similar to JSON, but supports comments, and does not require strings to
   be quoted, except when necessary to distinguish them from other data
   types.

 * Allows simple configurations to be written simply by people with minimal
   technical knowledge, while supporting several widely-used data types,
   including strings, numeric types, booleans, lists, and dictionaries.
   Nested data structures are also supported.

This is the Chicken Scheme implementation of RASCL. In addition to the basic
language features, this implementation guarantees to preserve the order of
the configuration file, so that configurations can be written either
programmatically or using a text editor without issues.
